# Workshop Step 4: Build Your Application (15 minutes) 🏗️⚡

Transform your specification and implementation plan into a working application using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

- ✅ Hand off complex projects to GitHub Copilot Agent Mode
- ✅ Guide AI through multi-file application creation  
- ✅ Make real-time adjustments during development
- ✅ Handle common development challenges with AI assistance
- ✅ Have a working prototype of your application

**Key mindset shift:** You're the **architect and project manager**, Copilot is your **full development team**.

## Part 1: Preparing for Agent Mode (3 minutes) 🎬

**Ensure you have:**

- [ ] `app-specification.md` - Your detailed app specification
- [ ] `implementation-plan.md` - Your step-by-step development plan
- [ ] Clear understanding of your MVP scope

**Quick setup:**

```bash
# Create development branch and structure
git checkout -b feature/build-app
mkdir src docs tests
```

**Activate Agent Mode:**

- Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) → "GitHub Copilot: Enable Agent Mode"
- Or click agent icon in Copilot Chat panel

## Part 2: The Perfect Handoff (5 minutes) 🤝

**Provide complete context to Copilot:**

```markdown
I need you to build my application based on the specification and implementation plan I've created.

**App Concept**: [Brief description from your spec]

**Specification**: 
[Copy/paste your complete app-specification.md content]

**Implementation Plan**:
[Copy/paste your complete implementation-plan.md content]

**Workshop Constraints**:
- We have about 10 minutes for implementation
- Focus on core MVP features only
- Prioritize a working demo over complete functionality
- Use the simplest possible technology stack

Please review this information and confirm you understand the project before we begin building.
```

> **📸 SCREENSHOT NEEDED**: Agent acknowledging the handoff with project summary

**Wait for Agent confirmation that includes:**

- ✅ App concept confirmation
- ✅ Core features to implement  
- ✅ Simplified approach for workshop timeline
- ✅ Files it will create

> **📸 SCREENSHOT NEEDED**: Agent response showing understood scope and file list

## Part 3: Guided Development Process (7 minutes) 🔧

### Phase 1: Foundation (3 minutes)

**Start building:**

```text
Yes, please proceed! Start with creating the basic project structure and main interface. 
Focus on getting something running quickly that we can then enhance.
```

**Monitor progress:**

- Watch as Copilot creates multiple files
- Review each file as it's created
- Ask questions if anything is unclear

**Test early:**

```text
Can you create a simple way to test this locally? 
What do I need to run to see the app in action?
```

> **📸 SCREENSHOT NEEDED**: Copilot creating multiple files simultaneously in VS Code
> **📸 SCREENSHOT NEEDED**: Basic app running in browser showing initial interface

### Phase 2: Core Features (3 minutes)

**Guide feature development:**

```text
Great progress! Now let's implement the core face detection feature. 
Can you add the functionality to:
1. Access the webcam
2. Detect faces in the video stream  
3. Show a mock identification when a face is detected
```

**Iterate based on results:**

```text
I see the face detection is working, but can we make the identification 
more realistic? Maybe add some mock contact data and show name + context 
when someone is detected?
```

> **📸 SCREENSHOT NEEDED**: Working face detection with webcam feed and identification overlay

### Phase 3: Polish (1 minute)

**Add finishing touches:**

```text
This looks great! Can you add:
1. Some basic styling to make it look professional
2. A simple way to add new contacts
3. Instructions on how to demo this app
```

## Real-Time Troubleshooting 🔧

**Common scenarios:**

**Too complex for timeframe:**

```text
This looks more complex than we need for the workshop. Can you simplify this 
to focus just on [specific core feature]? Let's create something that works 
in our remaining time.
```

**Missing dependencies:**

```text
I see this needs [library name]. Can you either:
1. Create a version that works with vanilla JavaScript, or  
2. Give me the exact steps to install the dependencies?
```

**Need to pivot:**

```text
Given our time constraints, can we pivot to a simpler version that demonstrates 
the core concept? Maybe [suggest simplified approach]?
```

## Success Metrics & Demo Prep 🎭

**Minimum Viable Demo:**

- [ ] Core concept clearly visible
- [ ] At least one main feature works
- [ ] Can be easily demonstrated to others
- [ ] Shows potential of the full idea

**Demo story structure:**

1. **Set context** (30 seconds): "I built an app that's like Shazam, but for people..."
2. **Show core feature** (1 minute): Demonstrate main functionality
3. **Highlight innovation** (30 seconds): Explain what makes your approach unique
4. **Discuss next steps** (30 seconds): What would you build next?

> **📸 SCREENSHOT NEEDED**: Final working app demo showing core functionality

## Expected Outcomes & Next Steps 📋

**By the end of this step, you should have:**

- [ ] Working application prototype
- [ ] Core feature demonstrating your concept
- [ ] Files organized in logical project structure
- [ ] Clear understanding of how to demo your app
- [ ] Experience collaborating with AI for complex projects

**Immediate next steps:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Built MVP with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode"
git push origin feature/build-app
```

**Quick Troubleshooting:**

- **Agent Mode not available?** → Update VS Code and Copilot extensions, restart VS Code
- **Code doesn't run locally?** → Ask for explicit setup instructions and dependencies
- **Features too complex for timeframe?** → Request simplified, workshop-appropriate versions
