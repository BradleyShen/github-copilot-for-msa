## Key Takeaways 💡

**Traditional Development:**

- Write every line of code manually
- Debug issues line by line
- Research solutions independently
- Linear, time-intensive process

**AI-Augmented Development:**

- Direct AI to generate code based on specifications
- Collaborate with AI for problem-solving
- Leverage AI for research and best practices
- Iterative, rapid prototyping approach

## Mental Model Shift 🧠

**From:** Developer as code writer
**To:** Developer as architect, project manager, and AI collaborator

**Your new role:**

- 🏗️ **Architect**: Design the overall solution and approach
- 📋 **Project Manager**: Guide the development process and priorities
- 🤝 **AI Collaborator**: Communicate effectively with AI tools
- 🎯 **Quality Guardian**: Review, test, and refine AI-generated solutions

## What's Coming Next 🔄

In the upcoming workshop steps, you'll experience this transformation firsthand:

1. **Step 2**: Learn to collaborate with AI for idea generation and refinement
2. **Step 3**: Use AI to create professional specifications and implementation plans
3. **Step 4**: Watch AI build your entire application based on your guidance
4. **Step 5**: Explore resources for continuing your AI development journey

## Questions for Reflection 🤔

As you move into the hands-on portions, consider:

- How might AI change the way you approach problem-solving?
- What aspects of development do you most want AI to help with?
- How can you leverage AI while maintaining your creative control?
- What new skills do you need to develop for effective AI collaboration?
