## Quick Reference Card üìñ

**Essential Commands:**

- `#` - Grounding and context setting
- `/create_specification` - Generate comprehensive project specifications
- `/create_implementation_plan` - Create detailed implementation plans
- `/new` - Create a new set of workspace files

**Best Practices:**

- Be specific and provide context in your prompts
- Iterate and refine AI responses through conversation
- Always review and understand AI-generated code
- Use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement for thinking

**Context Engineering Tips:**

- **Break large tasks down** ‚Äì just like us, AI can get ‚Äústuck‚Äù or confused if they try to do too much at once. Start with specifications and create implementation plans and provide them to the AI as context.
- **Be explicit and give context** ‚Äì Although AI might be able to figure out the right answer, it isn‚Äôt a mind reader. Explicitly reference code files, code docs and spec, package versions and docs and tools. Use #, @ and /.
- **Provide grounding** ‚Äì Grounding the Agent with additional knowledge about how/what/why. ‚ÄúHow do you want this done?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy does this matter?‚Äù. It‚Äôll make better decisions when it doesn‚Äôt know the answer but knows these things.
- **Give instructions** ‚Äì Agents can ‚Äúfigure out‚Äù complex tasks, but they‚Äôre faster and give you higher quality output if you give them explicit steps on how to accomplish the task.
